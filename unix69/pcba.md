flexible layout

### pi60 HSE

staggered hotswap sockets support both ANSI and Tsangan

incompatible with per-key RGB LEDs where alternative key positions
have sockets above and below

### planck hot-swap

another example of staggered sockets

reduced height
--------------

  * 1.5 mm plate
  * 3.5 mm switch bodies
  * 1.5 mm pcb
  * 2.0 mm hotswap sockets
  * 1.5 mm base

total 10 mm

USB-C dimensions

  * 1.5 mm plug clearance
  * 3.5 mm USB-C socket
  * 1.5 mm PCB / plug clearance

mid-mount USB-C socket is flush with one side of PCB

  * 1.5 mm plug clearance
  * 2.0 mm socket
  * 1.5 mm PCB
  * 1.5 mm plug clearance

mid-mount socket might fit in the usual place between esc and 1 ?
or centred between 7 and 8 ?

(won't be compatible with standard cases)

USB plug positions:

(first two need a PCB extension)

  * top mount
      - 0.0 mm above
      - 1.5 mm plate / plug clearance
      - 3.5 mm switch bodies / socket
      - 1.5 mm pcb / plug clearance
      - 2.0 mm components / below
      - 1.5 mm base / below

  * upper mid-mount
      - 1.5 mm plate / above
      - 1.5 mm switch bodies / plug clearance
      - 2.0 mm switch bodies / socket
      - 1.5 mm pcb / socket
      - 1.5 mm components / plug clearance
      - 0.5 mm components / below
      - 1.5 mm base / below

  * lower mid-mount
      - 1.5 mm plate / above
      - 2.0 mm switch bodies / above
      - 1.5 mm switch bodies / plug clearance
      - 1.5 mm pcb / socket
      - 2.0 mm components / socket
      - 1.5 mm base / plug clearance
      - 0.0 mm below

  * bottom mount
      - 1.5 mm plate / above
      - 3.5 mm switch bodies / above
      - 1.5 mm pcb / plug clearance
      - 2.0 mm components / socket
      - 1.5 mm base / socket
      - 1.5 mm overhang / plug clearance

### Drop Alt

Upper mid-mount USB-C.

PCB is larger than usual with edge-mounted RGB LEDs
and extra projections for the USB sockets

The case is supposed to be 9mm thick; I guess they shaved some space
from the components and used a really thin baseplate

### KBDcraft Adam

Top-mount USB-C

Sticks out on a finger of board into high-profile case surround.
