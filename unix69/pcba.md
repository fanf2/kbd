pcba notes
==========


reduced height
--------------

USB-C socket is 3.5 mm thick

A mid-mount socket flush with the top of the board projects 2mm from
the bottom, same as hotswap sockets.

Bit tight for space but might fit in the usual place between esc and 1?

(won't be compatible with standard cases)

### Drop Alt

Mid-mount USB-C, flush with lower side of board, projecting from upper side

PCB is larger than usual with edge-mounted RGB LEDs
and extra projections for the USB sockets

flexible layout
---------------

### pi60 HSE

staggered hotswap sockets support both ANSI and Tsangan

incompatible with per-key RGB LEDs where alternative key positions
have sockets above and below
