# A MIDI step sequencer, with four tracks and eight steps per track.

# The eight steps are on the top two rows of keys. Steps can be toggled on by 
# tapping a step's key. Active steps are indicated with a brighter LED, and the
# currently playing step in the sequence is shown with a moving LED across the
# eight steps.

# Each track is colour-coded: track 1 is orange, track 2 blue, track 3 is pink,
# and track 4 is green. Tracks can be selected by pressing and holding the 
# bottom left orange track select key and then tapping one of the four track
# keys on the row above. The currently focussed track's track select key (on the
#Â second bottom row) is highlighted in a brighter colour.

# A track can be toggled on or off (no notes are sent from that track, but notes
# are not deleted) by tapping the track's track select key. The track select LED
# for a track toggled off will not be lit.

# The sequencer is started and stopped by tapping the bottom right key, which is
# red when the sequencer is stopped, and green when it is playing.

# The sequencer can be cleared by holding the track selector key (orange, bottom
# left) and then holding the start/stop key (red/green, bottom right).

# A single track can be cleared by holding the track selector key, the track
# select key (on the second bottom row) for the track you want to clear, and
# then holding the start/stop key.

# Tempo can be increased or decreased by holding the tempo selector key (blue,
# second from left, on the bottom row) and then tapping blue key on the row 
# above to shift tempo down, or the pink key to shift it up. Tempo is increased/
# decreased by 5 BPM on each press.

# If an active step is held down, the second bottom row of keys lights to allow
# the note to be shifted down/up (the left two keys, decremented/incremented by
# one each time) and the note velocity to be shifted down/up (the right two keys
# decremented/incremented by four each time).

# You'll need to connect Keybow 2040 to a computer running a DAW like Ableton,
# or other software synth, or to a hardware synth that accepts USB MIDI.

# Tracks' notes are sent on MIDI channels 1-4.

# Drop the keybow2040.py file into your `lib` folder on your `CIRCUITPY` drive,
# and then save this code in the `code.py` file.

# NOTE! Requires the adafruit_midi CircuitPython library also!
