"""superellipses and superellipsoids

There are two complementary definitions of a superellipse, depending
on whether the author prefers [the implicit equation][enwp] or [the
parametric equation][bourke] (scroll down past the sportsball
section). In the implicit version, superellipses are ellipses when
`e = 2` and get more rectangular (hyperelliptical) for larger `e`,
and more pointy (hypoelliptical) for smaller `e`. In the parametric
version, superellipses are rectangles at `e = 0`, ellipses at `e =
1`, and pointy for larger `e`.

[enwp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superellipse
[bourke]: https://paulbourke.net/geometry/spherical/

This code uses the parametric form to draw hyperellipses with
exponents less than 1.

In the same way that ellipses are scaled circles, superellipses are
scaled squircles. Therefore this code only constructs squircles; the
result must be scaled to get a superellipse. Similarly in three
dimensions for superellipsoids.

We approximate a superellipse by dividing it into sectors. The
superellipse's parameter `theta` ranges from 0 to `tau`; each sector
is an equal subdivision of this range. (But not an equal subdivision
of the resulting superellipse owing to its exponent.)

We can calculate the tangents at the points between each sector of
the superellipse. These determine a quadratic B√©zier for each
segment. We don't have to use too many segments to get a good enough
approximation to the superellipse.
