notes on keycaps
================

The idea is to make a case that curves to match a sculpted keycap
profile. So we need to know what the heights of the keycaps are...

Sadly, https://keycaps.info/ lacks measurements - it would be
necessary to extract them from the SVGs.

Row numbering is from back to front, R0 for function keys, R5 for
space and modifiers. (matt3o's numbering)


Akko

<https://en.akkogear.com/faq/akko-keycaps-profile-comparison/>

The Akko OEM and Cherry measurements are suspicious, because they show
Cherry as higher than OEM and it's supposed to be the other way round.
And the OEM heights disagree with Max Keyboard.

But I guess the measurements for their own profiles are correct.

(also, what's up with their inconsistent row numbering?!)
