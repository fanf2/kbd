notes on keyswitches
====================

Generalally I prefer tactile keys, because they indicate the actuation
point without making a lot of noise (like clicky keys). Linear keys
have advantages for gaming when you want to oscillate around the
actuation point.

Cherry MX Clear
---------------

I like [Cherry MX Clear](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-special/mx-clear.html)
because the spring force increases a lot after the actuation point, so
it's relatively easy to type on them without bottoming out. This makes
them a bit like a short-travel keyboard that botttoms out really
softly.

The force curve for many tactile switches has about the same force
for the tactile point and for bottoming out, so there are fewer cues
for the typist about the vertical position of their fingers.

alternatives?
-------------

I think I would like a similar force curve to the clears -- the spring
force after actuation is larger than the tactile force, and the
tactile bump is very distinct -- but with a lower actuaton force and
shorter travel to actuation.

      * seem to have a similar force curve to clears

modifiers
---------

Modifier keys are an exception to my general preference for tactile keys.

I'm currently using [Cherry MX Silent Black](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-original/mx-silent-black.html)
as a rough match for the force of Clears without the tactile bump.
This is a new-ish experiment; matching the force was kind of a guess.

It's worth considering [Cherry MX Speed Silver](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-original/mx-speed-silver.html)
as an alternative, based on the observation that modifiers are often
pressed by the little finger, so a lighter spring might make sense.

bottom row
----------

I am still experimenting with my space bar.

I currently have a [Cherry MX Grey](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-special/mx-grey.html)
switch, because it is apparently common to have a harder switch in the
space bar compared to the rest of the keyboard. (So, for example,
black is the space switch for a mostly-red keyboard, green is the
space switch for a mostly-blue keyboard.)

The grey bottom-out force is about the same as in a clear switch,
100g, though the tactile force is 80g instead of 60g.
