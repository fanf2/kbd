Tony Finch's keyboard projects
==============================

This repository is where I keep my work on custom mechanical
keyboards.


[HHKBeeb](./hhkbeeb/)
---------

The first keyboard I built is a tribute to the BBC Micro made in the
run-up to its 40th anniversary in 2021.

It uses a [Yiancar HS60](https://yiancar-designs.com/portfolio/337/)
PCB and a generic HHKB case, and keycaps designed by me and printed by
WASD.

The project directory [hhkbeeb](./hhkbeeb/) also contains designs for
an acrylic sandwich case that I never made.

> The default branch in this repository is jokingly called `model-b`
> because git's default branch used to be `master`, and both are kinds
> of BBC Micro.


[Keybird69](./keybird69/)
-----------

In 2023 I designed a 65% keyboard with a "unix69" layout. It uses a
Waveshare RP2040-Tiny controller on a PCB designed by me. The case is
a sandwich of FR-4 and LEGO.

I have assembled three versions of Keybird69:

 1. with Cherry MX Clear switches and Signature Plastics DSS
    "Dolch" keycaps

 2. Cherry MX Clear switches again but with the springs
    lubericated to eliminate their pinging; and with
    [matt3o](https://matt3o.com)'s GMK MTNU Susu keycaps.

 3. Gateron CAP milky brown switches with JTK HSA Hyperfuse keycaps


[Keybird42](./keybird42/)
-----------

My late 2023 / early 2024 work in progress is series of 77% boards:

  - bigger than 75%
  - fewer keys than 80%
  - more symmetrical

They are called keybird42:

  * 42 cm wide PCB
  * 21 keys wide (42 / 2)
  * 84 keys total (42 * 2)

The first version will have a layered acrylic case; there may be others.
