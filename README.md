A keyboard like the BBC Micro, made from modern parts
=====================================================

It's the 40th anniversary of the BBC Micro this year. I am trying to
make a keyboard in a similar style, made from modern parts.

The Beeb's keyboard was what is now called a mechanical keyboard.
There's a very lively community of mechanical keyboard makers and
customizers, who have made it fairly easy to get a long way with
off-the-shelf parts.


The BBC Micro keyboard
----------------------

The Beeb's keyboard was mostly a standard [ECMA-23][] layout. The main
oddity from today's point of view is that it has a [bit-paired][]
punctuation layout.

In addition to the basic ECMA-23 keys (all black) the Beeb has some
colourful extras: red function keys and greenish brown arrow keys.

[ECMA-23]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMA-23
[bit-paired]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit-paired_keyboard

I have drawn the [BBC Model B][] and [BBC Master][] keyboard using the
online [Keyboard Layout Editor][] (KLE).

Modern keyboard sizes
---------------------

Key sizes are usually quoted as so many "u", as in units, which are
the size of one standard key. 1u is 0.75 inches.

There are a number of common form-factors:

  * Tenkeyless, aka TKL: Like a full-size keyboard without the number
    pad (which has more than 10 keys, shrug)

  * 60%: Just the main block of the keyboard; no function keys or
    arrow keys etc. The overall size is 15u x 5u, typically with 61
    keys.

  * 75%: Like a TKL but with the function and arrow keys smooshed
    together, so there's a single block of keys. The overall size is
    16u x 6u, typically with 84 keys.

The more we re-use one of these standard layouts, the easier it will
be to build (e.g. using off-the-shelf cases and PCBs) at the cost of
authenticity.


Adjusting the BBC Micro layout
------------------------------

The Beeb keyboard is slightly wider than a 75% board: CAPS LOCK and
SHIFT LOCK stick out 0.25u on the left, and DOWN sticks out 0.5u on
the right. It can be made to fit in a 75% case by using a BBC Master
arrow cluster, and by displacing the LOCK keys. To be usable with a
modern operating system, the keyboard also needs a few more modifier
keys.

My [BBC Master 75%][] layout is based on those ideas. However, fitting
in the 75% form factor isn't as useful as it might be: in typical 75%
case designs, there are PCB mounting holes mid-way between some of the
function keys, which are aligned with the number row below; but the
Beeb's function keys are offset by 0.5u so they clash with the
mounting holes.

A standard 75% ISO board could be given a Beebish appearance with just
some replacement keycaps, like my [Beeb 75% ISO][] layout.

I like small keyboards, so I have made a [Beeb 60% HHKB][] layout.
This has a jokey number row that goes 0-9 (like the BBC Micro function
keys) and is shifted towards the centre.

Keycaps
-------


Fonts
-----

The BBC Micro keycaps were made by Comptec, who are now known as
[Signature Plastics][]. Their main style of legends is called "Gorton
Modified", named after Gorton engraving machines.

There are a number of fonts made in the style of engraving machines.

The best I have found so far is [Routed Gothic][], which has a large
repertoir of characters, though some of them are not good matches for
Gorton Modified.

[Open Gorton][] has better matches for some character shapes; it
covers ASCII only.

There is another font called [Gorton Digital][], which is available as a
FontForge script not as built font files. Unfortunately the script
produced mangled output when I tried it, though some of the characters
are usable.

Also worth noting is [National Park][], whose repertoir is roughly
ISOÂ 8859-1.

[Gorton Digital]: https://github.com/drdnar/GortonDigital
[National Park]: https://nationalparktypeface.com/
[Open Gorton]:  https://github.com/dakotafelder/open-gorton
[Routed Gothic]: https://webonastick.com/fonts/routed-gothic/

What I have found works best is a combination of Routed Gothic, Routed
Gothic Wide, and Open Gorton.


### Detailed notes on keycap fonts

CTRL, SHIFT, etc. are all Routed Gothic, except for ESCAPE which is
Routed Gothic Narrow.

Most of the letters and digits are Routed Gothic Wide. A few letters
are Routed Gothic (non-wide): R S B

J is problematic: Open Gorton has a more authentic glyph shape, but
its weights dont match Routed Gothic (regular is too loght; bold is
too heavy).

Zero is a Scandinavian capital slashed O and the correct 1 is found in
Routed Gothic's private use character codes.

3 is problematic. Again, Open Gorton has a more authentic shape
(rounded top instead of angular), but its numerals are too narrow.

For punctuation, #$%&@*^~,.;:<> come from Open Gorton; "(){}[]
from Routed Gothic Wide, and -=`'/|\?! from Routed Gothic.

For symmetry I used reversed prime and prime for `' and rotated them
slightly to make them more distinct. | is a broken bar, _ is an
em-dash, and - is an en-dash.

I upped the font size a lot for ,.;:^~*

The * on the BBC micro has 6 points; Open Gorton has 8 points, a bit
like the * on the BBC Master's numeric keypad (though I think Open
Gorton has shorter points). Gorton Digital has a fairly nice 5-point
asterisk which is a plausible alternative.
