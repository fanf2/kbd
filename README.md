Tony Finch's keyboard projects
==============================

This repository is where I keep my work on custom mechanical
keyboards.


[HHKBeeb](./hhkbeeb/)
---------

The first keyboard I built is a tribute to the BBC Micro made in the
run-up to its 40th anniversary in 2021.

It uses a [Yiancar HS60](https://yiancar-designs.com/portfolio/337/)
PCB and a generic HHKB case, and keycaps designed by me and printed by
WASD.

The project directory [hhkbeeb](./hhkbeeb/) also contains designs for
an acrylic sandwich case that I never made.


[Keybow 2040](./circuitpy/)
-------------

I have some CircuitPython files containing the configuration for my
[Pimoroni Keybow 2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/keybow-2040)

More recently [I have ported QMK to the Keybow
2040](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/21481)


[Keybird69](./keybird69/)
-----------

In 2023 I made a 65% keyboard with a unix69 layout. It uses a
Waveshare RP2040-Tiny controller on a PCB designed by me. The case is
a sandwich of FR-4 and LEGO.

The completed Keybird69 has Cherry MX Clear switches and Signature
Plastics DSS "Dolch" keycaps.


[Keybird74](./keybird74/)
-----------

Some notes on the next keyboard with a few more keys.
